I am a PhD candidate at Humphrey School of Public Affairs in University of Minnesotaâ€“Twin Cities. At present, my research focus is on labor economics, to be more specific, how would occupational licensing affect the labor market outcomes including wages, hours worked as well as employment. I am also working with Institute for Social Research & Data Innovation (ISRDI) at Minnesota Population Center (MPC) to collect occupational licensing requirements data from statutes and regulations.

I also have diverse research and working experiences on labor-economics related topics at different levels of governmental sectors: I recently worked for the Chief Evaluation Office at Department of Labor in collective bargaining related research; I collaborated with the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and evaluated the economic effects of Humphrey-Hawkins Act; and I worked as a data and policy analyst at the licensing and background studies divisions in Minnesota Department of Human Services for a year.
