Occupational licensing is more prevalent in the public
sector in the U.S. relative to the private sector, but the influence
of occupational regulation for these workers has not been analyzed in
detail. Our study initially examines the influence of occupational
licensing on the choice of working in the public sector. We next
examine how licensing impacts key labor market outcomes, such as
wages, hours worked and employment in the public sector. Our results
find that occupational licensing increases the likelihood of working
in the public sector. However, being in a licensed occupation in the
public sector raises wages by about 6 percent, increases hours worked,
but reduces employment, even when controlling for other labor market
institutions that also are more prevalent in the public sector such as
unionization status. Overall our estimates suggest that the social
welfare effects of licensing in the public sector is similar to the
private sector, and it generally results in a welfare loss in this
sector of the economy. The empirical analysis in this paper uses both
the SIPP and CPS data.
