This paper is trying to use multiple empirical methods to look at the kernel
density distributions of wage between racial groups of Asian and White, and occupational
licensing groups of licensed and unlicensed workers, as well as how racial and licensing
factors interact with each other when affecting wage distributions. It finds that licensed
workers enjoy a wage premium at the upper tail of the wage distribution, while unlicensed
workers have higher wages at lower tail of the wage distribution. When putting racial factor
into consideration, Asian workers tend to enjoy more unlicensed wage premium. White
workers enjoy a wage premium at the middle wage distribution, while Asian workers enjoy a
wage premium at the upper tail of the wage distribution. There seem to be no racial wage
differential at the lower left tail of the wage distribution. When putting licensing factor into
consideration, licensed workers tend to experience higher racial wage gap in the middle wage
distribution compared with unlicensed workers. Using Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition, the paper finds
that licensing takes up around 9% of the explained mean racial wage difference; the
unexplained difference only takes up around 11% of the total racial wage difference. Both
Asian and White group tend to benefit more at the upper right tail of the wage distribution if
they have another groupâ€™s licensing rate. The returns to occupational licensing are higher for
Asians when compared to the white, and the wage premium found here is relatively smaller
compared with the literature.
