Working Draft

Licensed occupations can be both complements to and substitutes for one another in
providing a service, and the extent as of who can do what tasks, which is the so called “scope of
practice”, is determined by government regulations. In this paper, the author examines two
similar occupations of opticians and optometrists, who are licensed in most of the states in the
United States and provide complementary services to patients and sometimes can serve as
substitutes as services providers. The paper primarily focuses on how the interactions between these two
occupations can affect the labor market; to be more specific, how would the supervision of
optometrists on opticians’ activities can yield impact on wage determination and employment
outcomes for the practitioners.
