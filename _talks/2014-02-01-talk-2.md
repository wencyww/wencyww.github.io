This is a report I contributed largely to when I was employed as an RA for Institute for Urban and Regional Infrastructure Finance (IURIF) at the University of Minnesota. In this report covering all fifty states over the fiscal years of 2015 through 2017, the Volcker Alliance focuses on five critical areas that explain methods used to achieve budgetary balance, as well as how budgets and other financial information are disclosed to the public. States were given grades of A to D-minus for their procedures for budgeting.
